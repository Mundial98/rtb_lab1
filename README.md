# MapReduce Overview

MapReduce is a programming model and processing technique designed to process large-scale data in a distributed and parallel manner. It involves two main operations:

Map Operation: The input data is divided into smaller chunks, and a map function is applied to each chunk independently. The map function transforms the input data into a set of key-value pairs.

Reduce Operation: The key-value pairs generated from the map operation are grouped by their keys. A reduce function is then applied to each group to process and aggregate the values associated with the same key.

The MapReduce framework is widely used for big data processing tasks as it efficiently distributes the workload across multiple computing nodes, thereby reducing the processing time.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

mapreduce.py: This is the main script that orchestrates the map and reduce operations. It takes command-line arguments to specify the operation (map or reduce), the map/reduce script file, the input data file, and the output file.

map_script.py: This is a sample map script file. You can replace this file with your custom map function to process the input data.

reduce_script.py: This is a sample reduce script file. You can replace this file with your custom reduce function to process the intermediate key-value pairs.

input.txt: This is a sample input file containing the data to be processed.

output.txt: This is the output file where the results of the map or reduce operation will be stored.

## How to Use

To use the MapReduce framework with your custom map and reduce functions, follow these steps:

Create your custom map function and save it in a file (e.g., my_map_script.py). The map function should read input data and emit key-value pairs.

Create your custom reduce function and save it in a file (e.g., my_reduce_script.py). The reduce function should process key-value pairs and produce the final output.

Run the MapReduce script mapreduce.py with the following command:

``` python
python mapreduce.py <operation> <script> <input_file> <output_file>
```

Replace <operation> with either "map" or "reduce" to specify the desired operation. Use <script> to specify the path to your custom map or reduce script. <input_file> should be the path to the input data file, and <output_file> should be the path where you want to save the results.

## Example
Let's demonstrate how to use the MapReduce framework with the provided sample scripts and data:

To perform the map operation, use the following command:
``` python
python mapreduce.py map map_script.py input.txt output.txt
```

This will apply the map_script.py to the input data in input.txt and save the intermediate key-value pairs in output.txt.

To perform the reduce operation, use the following command:
``` python
python mapreduce.py reduce reduce_script.py output.txt output_final.txt
```
This will apply the reduce_script.py to the intermediate data in output.txt and save the final output in output_final.txt.
